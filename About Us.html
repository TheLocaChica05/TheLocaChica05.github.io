    <h4 class="card-title"> Leader in GPU Computing</h4>
            <p>Starting out in PC graphics, NVIDIA helped build the gaming market into the largest entertainment industry in the world today. Its invention of the GPU in 1999 made possible real-time programmable shading, which defines modern computer graphics, and later revolutionized parallel computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI — the next era of computing — with the GPU acting as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Nvidia has pioneered a supercharged form of computing loved by the most demanding computer users in the world — scientists, designers, artists, and gamers.
            NVIDIA GPU computing has become the essential tool of the da Vincis and Einsteins of our time. For them, we’ve built the equivalent of a time machine.
            Fueled by the insatiable demand for better 3D graphics and the massive scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtual reality, high performance computing, and artificial intelligence.</p>
